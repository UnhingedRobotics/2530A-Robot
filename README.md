# 2530A Robot Code  

## About This Repository  

Welcome to the code repository for **Team 2530A**, where we document the development of our robot's software for the 2024â€“2025 VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) season. This repository contains all the code our robot will run during competitions, including templates, control systems, and experimental features.

**Note**: This uses a Linux vexcom file, to switch over to windows please check the [**vexcodetext repo**](https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext)

## Features  

### Current Implementations

## Development Process  

This repository has evolved over the course of the season, starting with a custom PID controller system. Below is a brief timeline:  

1. **Initial PID Controller**:  
   Created and deployed for our first tournament to control basic motion.  

2. **Exploration of Tools**:  
   Originally, we considered using [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), but it was challenging to set up with our environment, especially when working with the VEX AI Vision Sensor.  
   - Although there are ways to make the sensor work with PROS, we opted for VEXcode initially.  
   - On my personal account, [SerrialError](https://github.com/SerrialError), I also created a [PROS project](https://github.com/SerrialError/x-drive-v5-pros) for an X-Drive as part of earlier experiments.  

3. **Switch to JAR Template**:  
   The current project is built on top of [JAR Template](https://github.com/JAR-Template), which uses the Apache License.  
   - All relevant contributions are documented in `NOTICE.md`.  
   - A detailed version history is available in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Usage Instructions  

### Setting Up the Repository 
I made a custom repository that allows you to interact with VEX directly through the command line and through makefiles. The name is [VEX Robotics Command Line Programming Environment](https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext), it is available for both Windows and Linux and more information can be found by clicking the link. Here is a list of steps on how to run it: 
1. **Download the Dependencies Listed on the [Github Page](https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext)**:  
   - Download and install gcc and clang.

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Clone or download this repository to your computer.  

3. **Change Any Software Modifications to Your Specific Hardware Design**:  
   - Change or get rid of the intake and/or fishmech.

4. **Download SDK**:
   - Run
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   in your terminal

5. **Deploy the Code**:  
   - Run
   ```bash
   make clean upload
   ```
   in your terminal

### Notes on Customization  
- **Hardware Adjustments**:  
  - You may need to modify the motor configurations to match your robot. The [JAR Template Documentation](https://github.com/JAR-Template/JAR-Template) provides instructions on adding, removing, and defining motors.  

- **Constants**:  
  - If using specific features (e.g., color sorting), you must update the constants to fit your robot's setup.  
  - Most constants are self-explanatory, but feel free to reach out with questions if needed.  

- **Autonomous Routes**:  
  - The current repository includes our autonomous routes, but these will need to be customized for your robot's field setup and objectives.

## Future Plans  

In the future, I plan to:  
1. Develop a standalone library to simplify integration of motion profiling, odometry, and path planning.  
2. Add support for autonomous path generation via tools like [Path Jerry IO](https://path.jerryio/).  
3. Transition back to PROS for advanced customization, including seamless integration with the VEX AI Vision Sensor.

## Features  
- Cross-platform support: Available for [**Windows**](https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext) and [**Linux**](https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext/tree/linux).  
- Fully text-based interface for streamlined workflows.  
- Supports building and uploading VEX Robotics programs using standard CLI tools.  

---

## Dependencies and Initial Necessary Steps for Linux 

To build and upload your VEX programs, you need the following tools installed on your system:  
- **clang**  
- **arm-none-eabi-objcopy**  
- **arm-none-eabi-size**  
- **arm-none-eabi-ld**  
- **arm-none-eabi-ar**  

### Installing Dependencies  

#### **Linux**  
1. Install the **ARM GCC toolchain**:  
   - On Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update  
     sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi  
     ```  
   - On Arch Linux:  
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-binutils  
     ```  
2. Install **clang**:  
   - On Debian-based systems:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt install clang  
     ```  
   - On Arch Linux:  
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S clang  
     ```  


### **Configuring Serial Connections with udev Rules**

To enable proper communication with the VEX Robotics hardware over a serial connection, you need to configure udev rules. This ensures that the device (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0) has the correct permissions for access.

#### Steps to Configure udev Rules:

1. Create a new udev rules file in the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/01-vex-v5.rules
    ```
2. Add the following line to the file to set permissions for VEX devices:

    ```bash
    KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", MODE="0666", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2888", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0503"
    ```

   - **Explanation**:
    - `KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*"`: Matches any device with the name pattern `/dev/ttyACM*`.
    - `MODE="0666"`: Sets read and write permissions for all users.
    - `ATTRS{idVendor}=="2888"`: Matches the VEX Robotics Vendor ID.
    - `ATTRS{idProduct}=="0503"`: Matches the VEX Robotics V5 Controller Product ID.

3. Save and close the file.  
   - In `nano`, press `Ctrl+O` to save, then `Enter` to confirm, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

4. Reload the `udev` rules:

    ```bash
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    ```
5. Unplug and reconnect the VEX Robotics device.

6. Verify the device is accessible:

    ```bash
    ls /dev/ttyACM*
    ```
#### Troubleshooting

- If the device is not recognized or permissions are incorrect, double-check the Vendor ID and Product ID using the lsusb command:
  ``` bash
  lsusb
  ```

Look for a line like:

  ``` bash
  Bus 003 Device 015: ID 2888:0503 VEX Robotics, Inc VEX Robotics V5 Controller
  ```

- Update the idVendor and idProduct values in the udev rules file if necessary.
