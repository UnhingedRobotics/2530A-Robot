# 2530A Robot Code  

## About This Repository  

Welcome to the code repository for **Team 2530A**, where we document the development of our robot's software for the 2024â€“2025 VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) season. This repository contains all the code our robot will run during competitions, including templates, control systems, and experimental features.  

## Features  

### Current Implementations  
- **Linear Motion Profiling with PID**:  
  A template for motion control using PID loops in conjunction with linear motion profiling.  

- **Velocity-Based Color Sorting**:  
  An advanced sorting system for a hook intake using the VEX AI Vision Sensor.  

- **Quadratic Velocity Controller**:  
  A custom velocity controller designed for improved drive performance.  

- **Basic Pure Pursuit Algorithm**:  
  An initial implementation of pure pursuit for path following (untested as of now).  

### Planned Features  
- **Odometry Integration**:  
  Adding support for precise robot position tracking.  

- **Path Generation Support**:  
  Future compatibility with tools like [Path Jerry IO](https://path.jerryio/) for autonomous route creation.  

- **Custom Library Development**:  
  A reusable library for motion profiling, odometry, and advanced algorithms, potentially ported to PROS.

## Development Process  

This repository has evolved over the course of the season, starting with a custom PID controller system. Below is a brief timeline:  

1. **Initial PID Controller**:  
   Created and deployed for our first tournament to control basic motion.  

2. **Exploration of Tools**:  
   Originally, we considered using [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), but it was challenging to set up with our environment, especially when working with the VEX AI Vision Sensor.  
   - Although there are ways to make the sensor work with PROS, we opted for VEXcode initially.  
   - On my personal account, [SerrialError](https://github.com/SerrialError), I also created a PROS project for an X-Drive as part of earlier experiments.  

3. **Switch to JAR Template**:  
   The current project is built on top of [JAR Template](https://github.com/JAR-Template), which uses the Apache License.  
   - All relevant contributions are documented in `NOTICE.md`.  
   - A detailed version history is available in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Usage Instructions  

### Setting Up the Repository  
1. **Install VEXcode Pro V5**:  
   - Download and install the [VEXcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode-download) plugin for Visual Studio Code (VSCode).  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Clone or download this repository to your computer.  

3. **Prepare the Project**:  
   - Copy the `vex` folder into this repository.  
   - Open the repository in VSCode.  

4. **Deploy the Code**:  
   - Use the VEXcode plugin in VSCode to upload the code to your robot's V5 Brain.  

### Notes on Customization  
- **Hardware Adjustments**:  
  - You may need to modify the motor configurations to match your robot. The [JAR Template Documentation](https://github.com/JAR-Template/JAR-Template) provides instructions on adding, removing, and defining motors.  

- **Constants**:  
  - If using specific features (e.g., color sorting), you must update the constants to fit your robot's setup.  
  - Most constants are self-explanatory, but feel free to reach out with questions if needed.  

- **Autonomous Routes**:  
  - The current repository includes our autonomous routes, but these will need to be customized for your robot's field setup and objectives.

## Future Plans  

In the future, I plan to:  
1. Develop a standalone library to simplify integration of motion profiling, odometry, and path planning.  
2. Add support for autonomous path generation via tools like [Path Jerry IO](https://path.jerryio/).  
3. Transition back to PROS for advanced customization, including seamless integration with the VEX AI Vision Sensor.
