Licensed under the MIT License.

Modifications have been made to the original code. See README, CHANGELOG, and source comments for details.

This project is also licensed under the MIT License, aswell as the projects that it is build upon, that I have made, - https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/vexcodetext and https://github.com/UnhingedRobotics/getvexsdk (which is a submodule). At one point it was said that JAR-Template was licensed under the Apache License inside of this repository, and there was no license for this project. Both of those pieces of information are incorrect.
